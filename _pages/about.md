Hi, there! I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaohu Yang](https://sfl.tongji.edu.cn/14/7e/c11234a136318/page.htm) and to collaborate with researchers from [The Center for Speech and Language Processing](https://cslp.tongji.edu.cn/) on speech disorders.

Research interests
======
What makes it effortful for older adults to engage with the changing world? I believe subtle clues can be found in their speech processing during daily life. As individuals age, they continue to absorb language knowledge from their surroundings, but they also experience deterioration in various mechanisms, including articulatory, auditory, and cognitive functions.

My research centres on the production and perception of speech prosody across adulthood, which has allowed me to explore the underlying mechanisms of speech disorders among aging populations. I am very keen to utilize interdisciplinary methodologies, including linguistic, acoustic, and psychological measurements, to address this issue.

Job seeking
======
I am actively seeking a postdoctoral position in areas related to speech disorders, starting in 2025. Please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:2110147@tongji.edu.cn) if you have any relevant opportunities or would like to discuss potential collaborations :)
